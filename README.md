Quora Full Access
=================

Quora Full Access (QFA) is an extension to unblock full discussion pages on Quora and bypass the nagging login/sign-up blocker.

I really like Quora, but I dislike their decision to not show any answer beyond the first unless you sign in.
I often search on Google with "site:quora.com" and when I reach the page I am interested in, I am shown the dialog to login with the other answers blurred.
To circumvent that, I wrote this little Chrome extension.

I'll probably write a Firefox extension for this soon.
