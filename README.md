Quora Full Access
=================

An extension to access the unblock full pages on Quora and remove the nagging login/sign-up blocker.

I really like Quora, but I dislike when their decision to not show any answer beyond the first unless you sign in. I often search on Google with "site:quora.com" and when I reach the page for the question that I am interested in, I am shown the dialog to login with the other answers blurred.

To circumvent that, I wrote this little Chrome extension. I'll probably write it for Firefox soon.
